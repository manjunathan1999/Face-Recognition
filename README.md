# Face-Recognition

## Description
This project is a face recognition system that uses a webcam to capture video and detect faces in real-time. The system uses the OpenCV library to perform face detection and recognition.

## Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/manjunathan1999/face-recognition.git
    cd face-recognition

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
Install cmake (cmake.org) ## Required

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Add some faces to the faces folder.
2. To use the face recognition system, run the following command:

    python app.py
3. The system will start capturing video from the webcam and display the video with detected faces highlighted in real-time.


## Future Improvements
This project is a starting point for building a face recognition system. There are many ways to improve the system, such as:
1. Capturing faces through the webcam
2. Improving the accuracy of the face detection algorithm
3. Adding support for multiple faces
4. Adding support for facial landmarks
5. Adding support for facial expressions
